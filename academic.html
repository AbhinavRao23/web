      <p>
        I graduated from National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK) in 2019, with B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering. Although I took a variety of courses ranging from mechanics & materials to optimization & intelligent systems, my extra-curricular projects/ interships/ thesis were mostly geared towards either automotive systems or robotics. Other than my own college, I also did a summer of research internship at IISc Bangalore, under the guidance of Prof. Satish Vasu, where I was tasked with design of a miniature fatigue testing rig.

          One of the most involving and rewarding experiences I had in college was my time with our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_Student">'Formula Student'</a> team, NITKRacing. NITKRacing is NITK's answer to the Formula Student question: Can a bunch of students make a Formula One style single seater performance car? Based on a rigorous rulebook, students are challenged to design, manufacture and (mock) sell a weekend racecar at competitions around the world. Formula Student is not only a excrutiatingly intensive student project but also grounds for valuable research, innovative solutions and even top spot for recruitments.

        I was a part of NITKRacing from 2016 to 2019 during which I participated in 3 events. In these events I was exposed to automotive engineering, industry experts, and invaluable team building experience. The design process encompassed everything from fancy FEM analysis for every manufactured component to fundamental mathematical models that the entire car was based on. Initially being heavily involved with part design such as pedals, uprights, wheel hubs, etc.; over time I slowly migrated towards suspension design and mathmatical modelling. I was also elected <b>captain</b> of the team for year 2018-2019.

          The rite of passage into engineering graduation at NITK includes a year-long thesis under the guidance of a disgruntled professor. A 'simulation' based thesis has become a norm in mechanical departments everywhere because of it's ease and convenience by averting the usual tassles of hardware. I was fortunate enough to find a team that reflected my desire of developing an actual working system. With this drive, we set out to develop a 3-PRRR parallel link manipulator. A manipulator is a sub-class of robot that doesn't have locomotive capabilities, it stays in one place and produces required movements.

        CNC machines, 3-D printers, robotic arms, assembly robots are few notable manipulators around. A parallel link manipulator on the other hand unlike a serial link robotic arm is much rarer and has more specific applications. We developed a parallel link manipulator using 3 decoupled arms each ran using a independent motor. Our aim was to generate some physical mass optimization in the arm design and also optimisation in the code, so that the entire system can be run on a common development microcontroller. The project was much more difficult than anticipated but we could present the model in due time with the planned position and velocity control. This and the detailed documentation earned our team a perfect grade in both semesters.

      <h4>IISc Summer Research Internship</h4>

          I was introduced to Indian Institute of Science, India's premier research institute as an intern trying to get some research experience. IISC is a universe onto its own. In the heart of Bangalore IISC boasts a lush campus, a decorated faculty and a rich history of seminal research. I had the the opportunity to work under the guidance of Prof. Satish Vasu Kailas on a short but interesting topic.Fatigue based design is a huge domain that spans mechanical design, civil engineering and structural engineering. Although designing a 'miniature fatigue testing rig' seems like a simple and straightforward problem statement for an undergrad student, I had no idea of the possible complexities.

      <p>
        Here I learnt that a project always begins with reading. I thoroughly familiarised myself with fatigue and it's mechanics, basic product design process, dynamics of scaling and FMEA. With that clarity I jumped into writing a requirement sheet, a preliminary FMEA and started the iterative process of designing the actual rig. In my brief period at IISc I was fortunate enough to work and contribute to this topic, and more importantly I was left humbled and hopefully wiser because of the advices and directions of Prof. Satish, for which I am forever grateful.

          As a part of the inter-branch course of 'Theory of Sensors and Actuators' NITK's Center for System Design tasked us with a practical project of bringing to life a model of a smart city. The problem statement was simple: Make model of a 'Smart City' that has 3 buildings and 3 bots, each tasked with priorities and functions. The entire model was to be controlled through a central user interface (a website).

      <p>
        The solution was to fill 3 buildings and 3 bots with a bunch of sensors and actuators and each with a microprocessor, each of which could serially communicate (i2c) with a central server (R-Pi). This central server handled all the high level tasks of scheduling the city tasks, path planning, the GUI and the communication between different modules. Some of my experience during this project with circuit design and system development comes useful now at Bosch RnD as we deal with similar problems only at a much higher level.

          I love tinkering around with small projects in my free time. Currently I am very interested in small-scale computer vision projects, especially semantic segmentation and object detection. I am hoping to implement a small ADAS setup, based on a R-Pi, with basic level  or level 1 capabilities.
