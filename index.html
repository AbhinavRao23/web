        At Purdue, I conduct my reseach as a part of the <a href="https://www.predictivesciencelab.org/" target="_blank">Predictive Science Lab</a> under the guidance of Prof. Ilias Bilionis. Our lab works on the intersection of machine learning and physics. This involves leveraging theory from physics and mathematics to define model structures that can be effectively conditioned on data/measurements. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Projects: My topics involve producing neural network-driven parsimonious surrogates for complex spatio-temporal fields/ PDEs. This domain of 'physics-informed machine learning' has shown rapid progress in the last decade alongside large-scale adoption and development of efficient deep learning tools such as XLA and Automatic Gradients. But there is significant work to be done in leveraging specific models that respect causality, fundamental symmetries and effectively combine multiple modalities of measurements. I hope to contribute to this effort. I usually write in python using PyTorch and Jax (Flax/ Equinox) for developing the models, and run the programs on Purdue's superclusters such as <a href="https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/compute/bell" target="_blank">Bell.</a>

      <p>
        I am particularly grateful to Eli Lilly Co. and their research collaboration with Purdue for funding my graduate study and providing a framework for effective research that is valuable to the community. I particulary within the section specializing in improving the effectiveness of injectable drug-delivery which is a perfect domain for physics-informed machine learning and uncertainty quantification given the various complexity of human body and the noisy sparse measurements, relative to mainstream AI research problems.   
      </p>

      <p>
        My plan of study during my graduate school revolves around courses of statistics and machine learning. As a part of the machine learning course I wrote a Conditional-GAN model and a custom FID protocol to  quantify the sensitivity of the model against hyper-parameters. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/AbhinavRao23/ece50024_finals"  target="_blank">here.</a>

        I worked for 3+ years at Bosch's research center: Technical Center India. I started as an intern, then a trainee and finally a system engineer/asst. manager. As an intern I was introduced to cloud-connected automobiles. Since this domain required expertise in multiple technology stacks - automotive systems, telemetry, cloud and data science; my training was tailored towards such expertise.  As a trainee I worked on coordinating software requirements for digitization in the supply chain domain. Then I worked on electric vehicles and their firmware validation, before finally transitioning to my longest role as a research engineer developing automotive connectivity software. This bottom-up transition from systems to firmware to software was essential towards setting a foundation for my data science journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        During my time in the connectivity research team, our small team of inter-disciplinary engineers tasked with the end-to-end development and validation of predictive diagnostic solutions for motorcycles. This involved developing software that when supplied with data from the specific vehicle could analyse it and assert the vehicles' health and predict failures. I was involved with making a testable platform of vehicle fleet, a communication infrastructure with custom protocols, a cloud driven data collection and analysis system and the solutions themselves. Our team worked with vehicles of different make, developed custom hardware for data collection and specifically wrote ML models in the form of cloud-APIs and apps to analyze collected data and display it to the user.
      </p>

      <p>
        I collaborated on a variety of projects within this connectivity project such as engine oil monitoring, vehicle battery monitoring and air filter monitoring, but personally led the development of two major solutions: sensor-less tire pressure monitoring and intelligent range estimation. These programs involved collecting time-series CAN data, utilizing efficient statistical methods ranging from Kalman filters to Neural Networks to make accurate judgements about the state of the vehicle. These works gave rise to accurate monitoring of vehicle health and quantification of complex sequences such as driving style and aggression. This further led to four patents in this area, 3 published by July 2022 (Application Numbers. 202241018611, 202141038618, 202141019724).

        My time at National Institute of Technology Karnataka involved working with various inter-disciplinary teams. During my undergrad I was particularly interested in teams & building things. I was a part of my college's Formula Student team, worked on various projects at the Center for System Design, briefly worked on a student satellite project, among others.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Final Thesis Project:</b> For my final bachelors' thesis I and a team of three other students chose to work on a robotics project. The advent of 3-D printing and small manipulators motivated us to design and optimize a 3-PRRR manipulator (in the image above). This included design and optimization in both the hardware and the software. We designed the entire structure in-house from scratch. The structural parts were designed through a design - optimization process focusing on improving rigidity while reducing weight. The software was written to get accurate position control of the end-effector using open-source hardware only. In the end we were able to showcase a working model of a 3PRRR manipulator with accurate position control with a simple arm design that was light and stiff enough for intricate applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Smart City Project:</b> As a part of the graduate level course ME827 (Theory And Practice Of Sensors And Actuators), 50 students were tasked to use the resources at <a href="https://csd.nitk.ac.in/" target="_blank">Center for System Design</a> at NITK to build a model smart city equipped with multiple buildings and vehicles. The objective of the city model was to completely automate the functionalities of the buildings and the vehicular bots, with prioritization, path planning and remote control through a web-app. From the bottom up, the technical stack in this project involved - mechanical design of components, mechatronic systems, circuit design, communication protocols (i2c & http), R-Pi driven path-planning and prioritization, and finally a GUI to make manual interventions.

        One of the most involving and rewarding experiences I had in college was my time with our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_Student" target="_blank">'Formula Student'</a> team, NITKRacing. NITKRacing is NITK's answer to the Formula Student question: Can a bunch of students make a Formula One style single seater performance car? Based on a rigorous rulebook, students are challenged to design, manufacture and sell a weekend racecar at competitions around the world. Formula Student is not only a excrutiatingly intensive student project but also grounds for valuable research, innovative solutions and project management.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was a part of NITKRacing from 2016 to 2019 during which I participated in three international events. In these events I was exposed to automotive engineering, industry experts, and invaluable team building experience. The design process encompassed everything from fancy FEM analysis for every manufactured component to fundamental mathematical models that the entire car was based on. Initially being heavily involved with part design such as pedals, uprights, wheel hubs, etc.; over time I slowly migrated towards higher lever system design, especially within vehicle dynamics. I was also elected <b>captain</b> of the team for year 2018-2019, during which we prioritized project management and documentation. We also made strides towards a more cohesive design process and shortened the timelines by almost half. 
      </p>

      <p>
        On the technical side: I was mainly involved with vehicle dynamics which involved design and fabrication of components in the chassis, suspension, tires, steering and braking systems. Initially I worked on understanding the mathematical side of automobiles. This included simple simulations of braking systems to the extremely complicated tire models such as Pacejka. Leveraging modeling and numerical analysis tools such as SolidWorks and Ansys, allowed us to design and optimize specific parts for specific manufacturing method. Finally after extensive iterative design process and verification, we finally fabricated said parts using methods like CNC, 3D Printing, Composite Casting, etc.

        During the summer of 2018, I was joined Indian Institute of Science as a summer research intern. This was my first experience in a formal academic research setting. This internship involved working under the guidance of <a href="https://mecheng.iisc.ac.in/people/satish-v-kailas/" target="_blank">Prof. Satish Vasu Kailas</a> within the operations of SIAM lab. Particularly I was asked to design a miniature fatigue testing rig and analze its failure modes. Fatigue based design is an inter-disciplinary domain with applications in robotics, mechanical engineering and civil/structural engineering.
      </p>

      <p>
        This internship involved understanding the theoretical foundations of fatigue, writing down technical requirements, making prototype CAD models, analyzing said models using mathematical methods as well as numerical ones (ANSYS solvers) and evaluating them against other designs. Since the requirements involved mechatronic elements, it meant designing the rig to include proprietary hardware like motors and sensors. I was exposed to each step of an iterative design process like design requirements, prototyping, design of experiments, validation, FMEA, and finally optimization. I am very grateful for Prof. Kailas' guidance during the entire process.
