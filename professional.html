        <p>Presently, I work at Bosch's two-wheeler research and development division as a system engineer/asst. manager. My projects revolve around data-based solutions and connectivity systems for two-wheelers. I've also interned at Bosch, Indian Institute of Science, HAL and Liquid Propulsion Systems Center (ISRO).</p>
        
        <p>Automotive connectivity research involves understanding a dense layered architecture spanning from the mechanical automotive systems, the sensor/controller network, the CAN and telemetry systems to the cloud architecture and the ML based programs to finally make sense of the incoming data. This kind of tall technology stack is particularly fruitful for an young engineer interested in system architecture. </p>

      <p>I use python 3 for most of my work as the usual requirements are either quick automation/analysis/visualization or writing data-processing functions. I've also worked with C, C++, JavaScript and Matlab in reasonable capacity before. I've always been very interested in hardware and mathematics which complements my current role revolving around AI in automotive connected systems. I am very interested in computer vision research projects and ADAS. <a href="mailto:abhinav3656@gmail.com">Email</a> me for my resume.</p>
