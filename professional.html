        <p>Presently, I work at Bosch's two-wheeler research and development division. My work revolves around data-based solutions for connected two-wheelers (V2C). Automotive connectivity research involves understanding a dense layered architecture spanning from the mechanical automotive systems, sensors & controllers, CAN, telemetry systems to the cloud architecture and the intelligent alorithms that derive utility from the data.</p>
        
        <p>In college, I worked on mechanical design & simulations of automobiles after which I briefly worked on automotive firmware, finally moving on to telematics and connectivity applications. This gradual bottom-up progression: 'core automobile engineering - automotive systems - firmware/software - connectivity and data-driven applications' has been very conducive for my development as an engineer interested in product/system development.</p>

      <p>I use python for most of my work, currently. I've also worked with C, C++, JavaScript and Matlab in reasonable capacity before. I've always been very interested in hardware and mathematics which complements my current role revolving around AI in automotive connected systems. I am very interested in connected and autonomous mobility. I am particularly fascinated by multi-disciplinary systems which require layers of diverse technologies and verticals to work together. I've also interned at Bosch, Indian Institute of Science, HAL and Liquid Propulsion Systems Center (ISRO).</p>
